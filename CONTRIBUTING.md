## Contributing

Contributions are very much welcome!

If you want to contribute code, fork the repo and make PRs to the `development` branch. Try to change as few things as possible per PR to make the reviewing process a bit easier!

Good things to contribute are:
* Popular variant defintions that are possible under the current system.
* Implementations of small issues in the issue tracker.
* Proposals for how to implement larger features. Probably best not to completely build these without proposing them since I use a fairly opinionated code style for Bishop.

Guidelines:
* Follow the Dart style guide in general.
* Try not to use `var` or `dynamic`.
* Use British English (pieces have a `colour`).

Feature and variant requests are also very much welcome! Feel free to create issues on the issue tracker.
